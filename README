1. Introduction
---------------

This package is a distribution of libraries for Chez Scheme; it provides
an  implementation of  the INFIX  macro which  converts the  traditional
infix  notation  for  expressions  to  the  equivalent  Scheme's  prefix
notation.

  The libraries  have no  dependencies; the  implementation itself  is a
single, definitive, kill'em all DEFINE-SYNTAX  form with the addition of
a few auxiliary syntaxes.

  The libraries  attempt to support  Chez 9.4, with the  main executable
installed as "chez".

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

3. Install
----------

Before installing Chez/Infix make sure  to have correctly installed Chez
Scheme with the main executable named "chez".

  To install  Chez/Infix from a  proper release tarball, we  must unpack
the archive then do:

   $ cd r6rs-infix-1.0.0
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make check
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the  "DESTDIR" environment variable to install
the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/infix

  If, instead,  we have checked out  a revision from the  repository, we
will have  to first build the  infrastructure running a script  from the
top source directory:

   $ cd chez-infix
   $ sh autogen.sh

notice that "autogen.sh" will run the program "autoreconf".  After this,
the procedure is the same as the  one for building from a proper release
tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  Libraries are installed under the directory:

			  $(libdir)/ChezScheme


4. Usage
--------

Read the  installed documentation in  Texinfo format.  In short,  to use
the  library just  import  (infix pratt)  and use  the  INFIX macro:  it
expands  to a  prefix  expression to  be evaluated  at  runtime, in  the
lexical  context of  the  macro  use; as  a  special  case "(infix)"  is
equivalent to "(values)".

  The macro allows us to evaluate forms like:

     (infix atan(1 , 2))	==> (atan 1 2)
     (infix 1 + 2 + 3)		==> (+ (+ 1 2) 3)
     (infix 1 + 2 * 3)		==> (+ 1 (* 2 3))
     (infix (1 + 2) * 3)	==> (* (+ 1 2) 3)

     (infix 2 expt 3 expt 4)	==> (expt 2 (expt 3 4))

     (infix - 5)		==> (- 5)
     (infix + 5)		==> (+ 5)
     (infix 5 !)		==> (factorial 5)

     (infix 1 > 2 ? 3 + 4 : 5 * 6)
     ==> (if (> 1 2) (+ 3 4) (* 5 6))

     (define a 1)
     (define b 2)
     (define c 3)
     (infix cos(a) * tan(b) / c)
     ==> (/ (* (cos a) (tan b)) c)


A. Credits

The library is the work of Marco Maggi.

  The "Pratt parser"  or "top down operator  precendence parser" concept
is from this paper:

   Pratt,  Vaughan.   "Top  Down  Operator  Precedence".   Massachussets
   Institute  of   Technology.   Proceedings  of  the   1st  Annual  ACM
   SIGACT-SIGPLAN  Symposium  on  Principles  of  Programming  Languages
   (1973).

  The implementation of XOR is by Derick Eddington.
